Internet of Things (IoT) describes applying internet technology to devices in homes, factories, or smart cities. Obviously this space offers tremendous potential for applications like energy management, predictive maintenance, and many more. With IoT being such a wide field, many different vendors are active in it. The W3C Web of Things (WoT) standard aims at overcoming the resulting interoperability challenge.

Several WoT SDKs and tools are already available. We are specifically interested in applications that make use of WoTâ€™s generic nature. This means that rather than building a solution for one application area, we want the solution to be able to provide value on top of any WoT device. We present a solution that allows for any WoT device to be connected. Leveraging JSON Schema, the system displays the device properties and displays generic forms for conveniently invoking device actions. We also introduce security, semantic mappings, and the ability to leverage artificial intelligence to interact with arbitrary devices more easily.
