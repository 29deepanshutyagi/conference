title: JSON Schema for data design & contract, client and code generation
position: Principal Software Engineer

At the DVLA we have been using JSON Schema for several years to define our domain and service models, and to generate associated resources across a number of tech stacks. Schema design is managed by product teams through version controller peer review, and composition patterns enable sharing of entities and properties across product team boundaries.

This talk will cover how we use these schemas throughout the software lifecycle, such as OpenAPI contracts, to generate interfaces for static languages such as TypeScript and Java. This approach improves developer experience and efficiency and enables validation of data across the organisation.
