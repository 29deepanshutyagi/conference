Hey there! I'm a Computer Scientist with experience in startups, open-source, and academia. Some facts about me:

- I'm co-authored an O'Reilly book: Unifying Business, Data, and Code: Designing Data Products with JSON Schema

- At University of Oxford, I won the 2022 CAR Hoare prize for the best dissertation and accompanying papers in the area of Software Engineering for my research around JSON BinPack. JSON BinPack made a breakthrough on 40 years of space-efficient telecommunication and binary serialization technologies, being more space-efficient than 13 other popular technologies in every single tested case

- I'm the original author of Etcher, a popular open-source cross-platform image flasher. This desktop app is recommended by a range of GNU/Linux distributions, and was highlighted on magazine

- I lead a London-based C++ open-source research lab called Sourcemeta providing cutting-edge JSON-related technologies. There, I maintain a custom JSON parser, JSON binary technologies, and a variety of JSON Schema related projects

- I own the Learn JSON Schema (https://www.learnjsonschema.com) reference documentation website, which serves more than 7k monthly users

- At Postman, I led the development of Starship, a C++ framework to create cross-platform native applications
