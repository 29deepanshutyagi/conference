title: Patterns for high perf, low alloc JSON Schema validation in .NET
position: Founder Director
---
We want to make JSON Schema validation a default procedure for any API. To do that, we need to make it a negligible part of the request handling budget, and low-overhead for the developer in the inner dev loop. In this talk, we look at how Corvus.JsonSchema addresses this for .NET, with a schema-first approach, and SourceGenerator support for a seamless developer experience.
