The Internet of Things (IoT) applies internet technology to devices in homes, factories, or smart cities, offering potential for applications like energy management and predictive maintenance. With IoT being a wide field, many vendors are active, creating interoperability challenges the W3C Web of Things (WoT) standard aims to solve.

We present a solution that connects any WoT device, leveraging JSON Schema to display device properties and invoke actions through generic forms. Additionally, we introduce features for security, semantic mappings, and AI integration to simplify interactions with diverse devices.
