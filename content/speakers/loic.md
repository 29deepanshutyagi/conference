Customers' Success is my focus and I constantly improve my skills with this objective in mind. Being passionate about Information & Data Management (Governance, Data Privacy, ILM, Architecture, Performance... in a new world of Real-Time Analytics, Artificial Intelligence and Fast Data Ingestion...), Application architecture and development (DevOps, Non-regression & Cloud Computing), Financial industry (Bank, Insurance)... I learn something new every day thanks to my customers and I love to bring them Solutions that fits perfectly their needs.

Right now, I'm evangelizing about Oracle *Public* Cloud incredible and sometimes unique on the market capabilities whatever the workloads and I'm Reviving the appeal for the Oracle *Multi-Model* Database and its associated Data Management huge differentiators for Application development... believe me, once you dig into it you just wonder: "Why I didn't know about it? That would have saved me many days if not weeks!" ðŸ™‚
