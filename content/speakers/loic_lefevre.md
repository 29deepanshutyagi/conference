As modern relational databases increasingly support JSON, it’s time to explore how JSON Schema can enhance database operations. This talk will dive into the newly developed 'Database Vocabulary,' authored by Oracle and proposed to the official JSON Schema specification. This vocabulary addresses key database tasks, including validation, type coercion, and metadata preservation, simplifying the management of JSON in databases.

With Oracle's latest release, 23ai, fully implementing this vocabulary, attendees will learn essential concepts and see real-world demos of JSON Schema validation in action. Whether managing large databases or building database-driven apps, this session provides practical tools for streamlining workflows.
