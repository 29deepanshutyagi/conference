Do you feel like you spend much of your day struggling with data and code, when that’s not your specialism or even your scientific interest?

That was how I felt as an engineer working in renewable power. I wanted to devote my time to assessing novel CFD techniques or implementing turbine analysis methods. But my progress was frustrated by the difficulties of reusing data.

I was not alone. Most scientists, in industry and academia alike, find they have to code in order to draw conclusions. You could say we’ve all become data scientists by default.

Octue was launched in 2017 with the mission to free up scientists everywhere to focus on their science. Today, our framework, tools and support help them take full advantage of data by making their data groundwork easier, quicker and more sustainable.

In addition to the open-source Twined framework that’s part of Octue’s core work, I also created and maintain EnvironmentStudio (https://es-flow.readthedocs.io), a tool for classifying chaotic turbulent behaviour in atmospheric and marine boundary layers.
